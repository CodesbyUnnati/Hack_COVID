                          <p class="card-text">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                            dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                            (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                            treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                            becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
                            and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
                            heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                            People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                            attention.

                       <p class="card-text">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                        disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                        the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                        coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
                        around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
                        these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                        People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
                        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
                        why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                        person who is sick

                       <p class="card-text">The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                        expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                        from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                        people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                        particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                        possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                        a mild cough and does not feel ill.

                          quite different.
                          SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
                          There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since

                      dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not

                     <p class="card-text">It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
                      surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
                      suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
                      COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                      several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
                      surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
                      If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
                      to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with 
                      an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
                      touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

                          alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 
                        </li>

                            Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                            droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                            are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                            COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

                        <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                          Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                          Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                          nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                          can make you sick. </li>

                          respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                          with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
                          dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                          Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                          hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                          cold, flu and COVID-19. 
                          </li>

                          Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                          Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                          information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                          allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                          health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                          of viruses and other infections. </li>
                        <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local

                          medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory
                          infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
                          provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.
                          Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
                          quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to
                          prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. </li>
